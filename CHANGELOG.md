# CHANGELOG

## 0.9.56

* Added a [docker image](docker/Dockerfile) with a configured and running endpoint.
* Added a [Makefile](Makefile) to simplify building and running the endpoint.
* Setup Wizard now doesn't ask for parameters specified through command line arguments.
  E.g., with `setup_wizard --lib-settings vpn.toml` it won't ask a user for the library
  settings file path.

## 0.9.47

* Removed RADIUS-based authenticator

## 0.9.45

* The executable now expects that the configuration files are TOML-formatted

## 0.9.38

* Fixed enormous timeout of TCP connections establishment procedure.
  API changes in the library:
    * added `connection_establishment_timeout` field into `settings::Settings`

  The executable related changes:
    * the settings file is changed accordingly to the changes described above

## 0.9.36

* The endpoint is now capable of handling service requests on the main tls domain.
  API changes in the library:
    * `tunnel_hosts` field of `settings::TlsHostsSettings` structure is renamed to `main_hosts`
    * `path_mask` field added into `settings::ReverseProxySettings`

  The executable related changes:
    * the settings file is changed accordingly to the changes described above

## 0.9.30

* Added support for dynamic reloading of TLS hosts settings.  
  API changes in the library:
    * `tunnel_tls_hosts`, `ping_tls_hosts` and `speed_tls_hosts` from `settings::Settings`,
      and `tls_hosts` from `settings::ReverseProxySettings` were extracted into a dedicated
      structure `settings::TlsHostsSettings`
    * Added a new method for the reloading settings: `core::Core::reload_tls_hosts_settings()`

  The executable related changes:
    * The TLS hosts settings must be passed as a separate argument (see [here](./README.md#running) for details)
    * The new settings file structures are described [here](./README.md#library-configuration)
    * The executable is now handling the SIGHUP signal to trigger the reloading
      (see [here](./README.md#dynamic-reloading-of-tls-hosts-settings) for details)

## 0.9.29

* Removed blocking `core::Core::listen()` method. The library user must now set up a tokio runtime itself.  
  The library API changes:
  * Removed `core::Core::listen()`
  * `core::Core::listen_async()` renamed to `core::Core::listen()`
  * Removed `threads_number` field from `settings::Settings`

  The executable related changes:
  * `threads_number` field in a settings file is now ignored
  * The number of worker threads may be specified via commandline argument (see the executable help for details)

## 0.9.28

* Added support for configuring the library with multiple TLS certificates.
  API changes:
    * `settings::Settings::tunnel_tls_host_info` is renamed to `settings::Settings::tunnel_tls_hosts` and is now a vector of hosts
    * `settings::Settings::ping_tls_host_info` is renamed to `settings::Settings::ping_tls_hosts` and is now a vector of hosts
    * `settings::Settings::speed_tls_host_info` is renamed to `settings::Settings::speed_tls_hosts` and is now a vector of hosts
    * `settings::ReverseProxySettings::tls_host_info` is renamed to `settings::ReverseProxySettings::tls_hosts` and is now a vector of hosts

## 0.9.24

* Added speedtest support

## 0.9.13

* Test changelog entry please ignore
